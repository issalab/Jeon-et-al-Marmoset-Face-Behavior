# Jeon-et-al-Marmoset-Face-Behavior
This repository contains face images used as stimuli for benchmarking the high-level visual abilities of marmosets in comparison with humans and models. It also includes images used for animal training. Face meshes were captured from real world faces and processed using <a href="https://github.com/issalab/Jeon-apple_facestim_generation">Jeon-apple_facestim_generation</a> and rendered using <a href="https://github.com/issalab/mkturk">mkturk</a>.

Repo accompanies the preprint:
